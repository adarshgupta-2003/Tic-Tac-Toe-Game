# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

I have developed a tic-tac-toe game using Python, employing only built-in functionalities and without relying on any external libraries. 
The game utilizes logics and file systems to interconnect among programs. <br>
<br>
The game can be played against a computer or 2 player !<br>
<br>
To experience the game, [download](https://github.com/Adarsh-2003/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip file and execute the 'StartGame.py' file and enjoy playing the game within your command-line prompt.
